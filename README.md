# SimpleDebtApp  Description

SimpleDebtApp is a minimalistic debt management application built using .NET MAUI and MVVM architecture. It allows users to track and manage debts efficiently through a user-friendly interface. The app features three main pages: a Dashboard displaying total debt and debt count, a Debt List showing all debts, and an Add Debt page for entering new debts. Data is stored locally using SQLite, ensuring persistence. The app sports a clean design with a green color scheme (#4CAF50, #2E7D32) and supports navigation via a tab bar. Currently, it uses mock data, with plans to integrate SQLite for full functionality.

Note: I've kept the description concise and aligned with the current state of your code (as shared), which uses mock data and is prepped for SQLite integration. Let me know if you want to tweak this description or proceed to the next step (Step 5: SQLite setup)! ðŸ˜Š
